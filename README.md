# Analyze sales data for a company including customer segmentation, and product performance 

The analysis leverages the Maven Analytics dataset, which contains comprehensive retail sales data.

The SQL Analysis: Retail Sales Trends, Customer Segmentation, and Product Performance project focuses on analyzing sales data for a retail company. The project utilizes SQL queries to extract valuable insights and provide meaningful analysis to stakeholders. The project covers various aspects, including sales trends, customer segmentation, and product performance. Through SQL queries, we explore sales revenue patterns over time, identify the highest-selling products, and analyze the performance of different product categories. Furthermore, the project delves into inventory data, providing information on stock levels in each store, identifying out-of-stock products, and determining average stock quantities per product across all stores. It also examines store-specific metrics, such as the store with the highest and lowest stock levels.

I gained valuable insights into analyzing retail sales data using SQL queries. I learned how to extract meaningful information from the data, identify sales trends over time, and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Additionally, I discovered techniques for evaluating product performance, such as identifying the best-selling products and analyzing sales growth or decline. Moreover, I acquired skills in inventory analysis, including assessing stock levels, identifying out-of-stock products, and calculating average stock quantities. Overall, this project enhanced my proficiency in utilizing SQL to derive insights and make data-driven decisions in the context of retail sales analysis.
